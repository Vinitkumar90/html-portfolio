<h1>**One Of The Best Animes**</h1>

<h3>According to vinit(no hate to any other anime ) - </h3>
<hr>

<h2>NARUTO</h2>
<p>It was one of my first anime , very good storyline and i will suggest first time anime watchers to start with . <br>
    And you can skip filler episodes</p>

    <h2>ONEPIECE</h2>
    <p>people say it is too long! but is definetly worth the watch .<br>
         Story revolves around adventure of pirate crew !!</p>

    <h2>DEMON SLAYER</h2>
    <p>without any doubt , it has got one of the best animations . <br>
        you will love it too!! story revolves around fighting demons.</p>
